# Poisson-ratio
Poisson ratio determined from triaxial testing 
In this script, 50% cut of peak stress method is used to determine Poisson ratio in Rocks, according to ISRM and ASTM standards. This script eliminates the error in finding the tangent value based on trial and error and find the optimal tangent on 50% peak stress through a rigorous search method. This script is specially useful as the data obtained from the triaxial experiment could be noisy and using trendlines in excel or other methods simply will not work.

To use the script: Save axial strain (%) as ea.txt (or simply insert into the script) , deviatoric stress as Sd.txt, and lateral (radial strain) as et.txt.
